# Anime Wiki project using PERN stack
# Server can be run from folder and client in seperate command console windows using npm run / npm start
# Work will begin soon to integrate running both the frontend and backend from a single terminal window and command, possibly using concurrently
# Additionally, a database must be set up and connected to on Postgres before the project can be initialized / worked with
# Once the initial setup is done, the project can be run and interacted with from that point without issue. 
# Eventually, the goal is to have this project deployed to github as a portfolio application.
# This will start small, with wiki options to add anime, tag them to genres, add tags, photos, titles, release dates, related franchises, etc
# Eventually the project will add login and registration, options to follow / watch db items, and more granular options

# Project may now be run using : 'npm run dev' from the root directory to run both the application as well as the express server concurrently while developing in a singular console window, this does allow nodemon to run for instantly reviewing changes to specific pages
